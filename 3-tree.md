**Tree**

Tree have a parent child relationship between items. It is like looking at a tree upside down with the root being the mother of everything. That is what we call a root node. Other parts connected to the root node are also nodes but more precisely a leaf. 

- ***Binary Tree***
It is a node with a maximum of two children.

- ***binary search tress***
More of a structural binary tree. All the nodes in the left sub-tree are less than or equal to the value of that node. Also, all the nodes in the right sub-tree of this node are greater than that of the parent node.

Needful operations required for a BST are insert and remove even though they need to maintain that BST remains with it's structure.
